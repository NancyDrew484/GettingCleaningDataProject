```{r }
require(data.table)
inputfile = "./finaldata.csv"
df1 <- fread(inputfile, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

str(df1)
```



2. finalmeans - a CSV file containing a tidy dataset with mean and std measurements, summarized by SubjectNum and ActivityNum

```{r}
inputfile = "./finalmeans.csv"
df2 <- fread(inputfile, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

str(df2)

```
